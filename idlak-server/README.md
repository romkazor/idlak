# Idlak Speech Synthesis Server

This server runs an RESTful API based on Python Flask.

This is a Rest API that allows registered users receive processed speech by sending a request. The server only contains two databases for authorisation and information about voices. The voices themselves are used from idlak, therefore the server is not usable alone and idlak has to be installed.

### Install server

To install the Rest server one must:

-  Have python (preferably version >= 3.5) with pip installed
-  And in the ```idlak-server``` directory
   -  Run command ```source setup-server.sh``` to setup flask
   -  Run command ```flask run``` to run the server
      -  when the server is ran for the first time, the initial admin user will be created and it's details presented in format
         ```<User userid:password:isadmin>```

Before installing and running the server make sure that the settings provided in config are correct. If you are not debugging or testing the server set logging to 'INFO', no sensitive data will be logged.

### Run server

To run the already installed Rest server one must:
-  In the ```idlak-server``` directory
   -  Run command ```source venv\bin\activate```
   -  Run command ```flask run``` to run on default host and port
   -  OR run command ```flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80``` to run on
      specific host and port

### Loading voices

In order for the users to get speech of any voice, the database must know about the voices and their location. To set a voice up, the server must be installed and in the ```idlak-server``` directory a command has to be run:

    ./seed/addvoice.py -g female -n Anastasia -i abr -d ../idlak-voices/tangle/s2/voices/ru/ru/abr

the different information based on the voice must be provided: gender, name, id and tpdb directory To remove voice information from the server, a command in the ```idlak-server``` directory has to be run:

    ./seed/removevoice.py -i abr

where the id of the voice has to be provided

Once the server has information of the voices, the user can access this information and get processed speech of these voices.
