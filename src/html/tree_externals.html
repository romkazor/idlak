Introduction</h1>
<p>This page gives an overview of how phonetic decision trees are built and used in Kaldi and how this interacts with training and graph-building. For a description of the internals, of the tree-building code, see <a class="el" href="tree_internals.html">Decision tree internals</a>; for more details on our approach to building decoding graphs, see <a class="el" href="graph.html">Decoding graph construction in Kaldi</a>.</p>
<p>The basic algorithm that is being implemented is a top-down greedy splitting, where we have a number of ways we can split the data by asking about, say, the left phone, the right phone, the central phone, the state we're in, and so on. The algorithm we implement is similar to the standard algorithm, see for example the paper "Tree-based State Tying for High Accuracy Acoustic Modeling" by Young, Odell and Woodland. In this algorithm, we split the data up by asking the locally optimal question, i.e. the one that gives the most likelihood increase, supposing we model the data on each side of the split by a single Gaussian. Differences from standard implementations include added flexibility about how to configure the tree roots; the ability to ask questions about the HMM-state and the central phone; and the fact that by default in the Kaldi scripts, the questions are automatically generated by a top-down binary clustering of the data, which means that it is not necessary to supply hand-generated questions. Regarding the configuration of the tree roots: it's possible to have all the statistics from all the phones in a single shared group that gets split (including questions about the central phone and the HMM-states), or to have individual phones, or HMM-states of phones, be the tree roots that get split, or to have groups of phones be the tree roots. For how to configure it using the standard scripts, see <a class="el" href="data_prep.html">Data preparation</a>. In practice we generally let each tree-root correspond to a "real phone", meaning that we group together all word-position-dependent, tone-dependent or stress-dependent versions of each phone into one group that becomes a tree root.</p>
<p>The rest of this page mostly gives details at the code level of what is happening.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="tree_window"></a>
Phonetic context windows</h1>
<p>Here we explain how we describe phonetic context in our code. A particular tree will have two integer values that describe the width and "central position" of the context window. The table below summarizes these values:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Name in code </td><td>Name in command-line arguments </td><td>Value (triphone)  </td><td>Value (monophone)   </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>N  </td><td>&ndash;context-width=?  </td><td>3  </td><td>1   </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>P  </td><td>&ndash;central-position=?  </td><td>1  </td><td>0   </td></tr>
</table>
<p>N is the width of the context window and P is the identity of the designated "central phone". Normally P is exactly in the middle of the window (hence the name "central-position"); for example, with N=3, we would normally have P=1, but you are free to choose any value from 0 to N-1; for instance, P=2 and N=3 means two phones of left context and no right context at all. In the code, when we talk about the "central phone" we always mean the P'th phone which may or may not actually be the central phone of the context window.</p>
<p>A vector of integers representing a typical triphone context window might be: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// probably not valid C++</span></div><div class="line">vector&lt;int32&gt; ctx_window = { 12, 15, 21 };</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Assuming N=3 and P=1, this would represent phone 15 with a right context of 21 and a left context of 12. The way we handle end effects is using zero (which is not a valid phone because it's reserved in OpenFst for the epsilon meaning "no symbol"), so for instance: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">vector&lt;int32&gt; ctx_window = { 12, 15, 0 };</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> means phone 15 with a left-context of 12 and no right-context because it's the end of the utterance. At the end of utterance in particular, the use of zero this way may be a little unexpected because the last "phone" is actually the subsequential symbol "$" (see <a class="el" href="graph_recipe_test.html#graph_c">Making the context transducer</a>), but for the convenience of the decision-tree code we don't put the subsequential symbol in these context windows, we put zero. Note that if we had N=3 and P=2, the above context window would be invalid because its P'th element would be zero which is not a real phone; also of course, if we had a tree with N=1, neither of the windows above would be valid because they are the wrong size. In the monophone case, we would have a window like: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">vector&lt;int32&gt; ctx_window = { 15 };</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> so monophone systems are just treated as a special case of context-dependent systems, with a window size N of 1 and a tree that doesn't do anything very interesting.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="tree_building"></a>
The tree building process</h1>
<p>In this section we give an overview of the tree-building process in Kaldi.</p>
<p>Even a monophone system has a decision tree, but a trivial one; see the functions <a class="el" href="namespacekaldi.html#af57f73e91015b439b4fd088fae3684f0">MonophoneContextDependency()</a> and <a class="el" href="namespacekaldi.html#affa38f40c50c61800f812a3012c5a08e">MonophoneContextDependencyShared()</a> which return such trivial trees. These are called by the command-line program <a class="el" href="gmm-init-mono_8cc.html">gmm-init-mono</a>; its main input is the <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1HmmTopology.html" title="A class for storing topology information for phones. ">HmmTopology</a> object and it outputs the tree, normally written as an object of type <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependency.html">ContextDependency</a> to a file called "tree", and also the model file (the model file contains a <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1TransitionModel.html">TransitionModel</a> object and an <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1AmDiagGmm.html">AmDiagGmm</a> object). If the program gmm-init-mono receives an option called &ndash;shared-phones, it will share the pdfs between specified sets of phones; otherwise it makes all the phones separate.</p>
<p>After training a monophone system starting from a flat start, we take the monophone alignments and use the function <a class="el" href="namespacekaldi.html#a8be6e4d8555478bf47183acd8d8337ee" title="Accumulates the stats needed for training context-dependency trees (in the &quot;normal&quot; way)...">AccumulateTreeStats()</a> (called from <a class="el" href="acc-tree-stats_8cc.html">acc-tree-stats</a>) to accumulate statistics for training the tree. This program is not limited to reading in monophone alignments; it works from context-dependent alignments too so we can build trees based on e.g. triphone alignments. The statistics for tree building are written to disk as the type <a class="el" href="group__tree__group.html#gab329e7820899feed82ce631806c61975">BuildTreeStatsType</a> (see <a class="el" href="tree_internals.html#treei_stats">Statistics for building the tree</a>). The function <a class="el" href="namespacekaldi.html#a8be6e4d8555478bf47183acd8d8337ee" title="Accumulates the stats needed for training context-dependency trees (in the &quot;normal&quot; way)...">AccumulateTreeStats()</a> takes the values N and P, as explained in the previous section; the command-line programs will set these by default to 3 and 1 respectively, but this can be overridden using the &ndash;context-width and &ndash;central-position options. The program <a class="el" href="acc-tree-stats_8cc.html">acc-tree-stats</a> takes a list of context-independent phones (e.g. silence), but this is not required even if there are context-independent phones; it is just a mechanism to reduce the size of the statistics. For context-independent hones, the program will accumulate the corresponding statistics without the keys corresponding to the left and right phones defined (c.f. <a class="el" href="tree_internals.html#treei_event_map">Event maps</a>).</p>
<p>When the statistics have been accumulated we use the program <a class="el" href="bin_2build-tree_8cc.html">build-tree</a> to build the tree. This outputs the tree. The program <a class="el" href="bin_2build-tree_8cc.html">build-tree</a> requires three things:</p><ul>
<li>The statistics (of type BuildTreeStatsType)</li>
<li>The questions config (of type <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1Questions.html" title="This class defines, for each EventKeyType, a set of initial questions that it tries and also a number...">Questions</a>)</li>
<li>The roots file (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>The statistics would typically come from the program acc-tree-stats; the questions configuration class would be output by the compile-questions program, which takes in a topology list of phonetic questions (in our scripts, these are automatically obtained from tree-building statistics by the program cluster-phones. The roots file specifies sets of phones that are going to have shared roots in the decision-tree clustering process, and says for each phone set the following two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>"shared" or "not-shared" says whether or not there should be separate roots for each of the <a class="el" href="hmm.html#pdf_class">pdf-classes</a> (i.e. HMM-states, in the typical case), or if the roots should be shared. If it says "shared" there will be a single tree-root for all HMM states (e.g. all three states, in a normal topology) ; if "not-shared" there would be (e.g.) three tree-roots, one for each pdf-class.</li>
<li>"split" or "not-split" says whether or not the decision tree splitting should actually be done for the roots in question (for silence, we typically don't split). If the line says "split" (the normal case) then we do the decision tree splitting. If it says "not-split" then no splitting is done and the roots are left un-split.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following will clarify some aspects of how this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we say "shared split", then even though there is one root node for all three HMM-states, the different HMM states can still get different leaves because the tree can ask questions about the pdf-class as well as about phonetic context.</li>
<li>We always share together the roots of all the phones that appear on a single lines of the roots file. This is not configurable via these strings because if you don't want to share the phones' roots, you can just put them on separate lines of the roots file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of a roots file; this assumes that phone 1 is silence and all the other phones have separate roots. </p><pre class="fragment">not-shared not-split 1
shared split 2
shared split 3
...
shared split 28
</pre><p> Having multiple phones on the same line is most useful when we have things like position and stress-dependent phones; in this case each "real" phone would correspond to a set of integer phone ids. In that case we share the roots for all versions of a particular underlying phone. Below is an example of a roots file for Wall Street Journal, from the egs/wsj/s5 scripts (this is in text, not integer form; it would have to be converted to integer form before being read by Kalid): </p><pre class="fragment">not-shared not-split SIL SIL_B SIL_E SIL_I SIL_S SPN SPN_B SPN_E SPN_I SPN_S NSN NSN_B NSN_E NSN_I NSN_S

shared split B_B B_E B_I B_S
shared split CH_B CH_E CH_I CH_S
shared split D_B D_E D_I D_S
</pre><p> When creating the roots file, you should ensure that at least one phone on each line is seen. For instance, in this case, if the phone AY was seen in at least some combination of stress and word-position, we would be OK.</p>
<p>In this example, we have various word-position-dependent variants of silence and so on. In this example they will all share their pdf's because they are on the same line and are "not-split"&ndash; but they may have different transition parameters. In fact, most of these variants of silence would never be used as silence never appears inside words; this is for future-proofing the setup in case someone does something weird in future.</p>
<p>We do the initial phases of Gaussian mixing up using the alignments from the previous (e.g. monophone) build; the alignments are converted from one tree to another using the program <a class="el" href="convert-ali_8cc.html">convert-ali</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="pdf_id"></a>
PDF identifiers</h1>
<p>The PDF identifier (pdf-id) is a number, starting from zero, that is used as an index for the probability distribution function (p.d.f.). Each p.d.f. in the system has its own pdf-id, and these are contiguous (typically there are several thousand of these in an LVCSR system). They are originally assigned when the tree is first built. Depending how the tree is built, it may or may not be possible to say, for each pdf-id, which phone it corresponds to.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="tree_ctxdep"></a>
Context dependency objects</h1>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependencyInterface.html" title="context-dep-itf.h provides a link between the tree-building code in ../tree/, and the FST code in ...">ContextDependencyInterface</a> object is a virtual base-class for the tree that specifies how it interacts with the graph-building code. This interface contains only four functions:</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependencyInterface.html#a5ab5836712a8f5537f9b88d05f429c42">ContextWidth()</a> returns the value of N (context-width) that the tree requires.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependencyInterface.html#a63785b3c15a9e59679d01e91ec5deb32">CentralPosition()</a> returns the value of P (central-position) that the tree requires.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependencyInterface.html#a43ded06ecf2478098f3d5636be757e5b">NumPdfs()</a> returns the number of pdfs defined by the tree; these are numbered from zero to NumPdfs()-1.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependencyInterface.html#add482cf5802e38844b4147007e7b3b2c">Compute()</a> is the function that computes the <a class="el" href="tree_externals.html#pdf_id">pdf-id</a> for a particular context (and <a class="el" href="hmm.html#pdf_class">pdf-class</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependencyInterface.html#add482cf5802e38844b4147007e7b3b2c">ContextDependencyInterface::Compute()</a> Compute() function is declared as follows: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">class </span>ContextDependencyInterface {</div><div class="line">...</div><div class="line"> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keywordtype">bool</span> <a class="code" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependencyInterface.html#add482cf5802e38844b4147007e7b3b2c">Compute</a>(<span class="keyword">const</span> std::vector&lt;int32&gt; &amp;phoneseq, int32 pdf_class,</div><div class="line">                      int32 *pdf_id) <span class="keyword">const</span>;</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> It returns true if it was able to compute the pdf-id for this context and <a class="el" href="hmm.html#pdf_class">pdf-class</a>.

<p>The <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependency.html">ContextDependency</a> object is actually a fairly thin wrapper for the <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1EventMap.html" title="A class that is capable of representing a generic mapping from EventType (which is a vector of (key...">EventMap</a> object; see <a class="el" href="tree_internals.html">Decision tree internals</a>. We wanted to hide the actual implementation of the tree as much as possible to make it easy to refactor the code later if needed.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="tree_example"></a>
An example of a decision tree</h1>
<p>The decision-tree file format was not created with human readability as the first priority, but due to popular demand we will try to explain how to interpret this file. Look at the example below this, which is a triphone tree from the Wall Street Journal recipe. It starts with <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependency.html">ContextDependency</a> which is the name of the object; then N (the context-width), which is 3; then P (the "central position" of the context window), which is 1, i.e. the center of the phone context positions since we are in zero-based numbering. The rest of the file contains a single <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1EventMap.html" title="A class that is capable of representing a generic mapping from EventType (which is a vector of (key...">EventMap</a> object. <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1EventMap.html" title="A class that is capable of representing a generic mapping from EventType (which is a vector of (key...">EventMap</a> is a polymorphic type which may contain pointers to other <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1EventMap.html" title="A class that is capable of representing a generic mapping from EventType (which is a vector of (key...">EventMap</a> objects. See <a class="el" href="tree_internals.html#treei_event_map">Event maps</a> for more details; it is a representation of a decision tree or set of decision trees, that maps from a set of key-value pairs (e.g. left-phone=5, central-phone=10, right-phone=11, pdf-class=2) to a pdf-id (e.g. 158). Briefly, it comes in three types: a <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1SplitEventMap.html">SplitEventMap</a> (like a split in a decision tree), a <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ConstantEventMap.html">ConstantEventMap</a> (like a leaf of a decision tree, containing just a number representing a pdf-id), and a <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1TableEventMap.html">TableEventMap</a> (which is like a table lookup containing other EventMaps). The <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1SplitEventMap.html">SplitEventMap</a> and <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1TableEventMap.html">TableEventMap</a> both have a "key" that they query, which in this case would be 0, 1 or 2 corresponding to left, central or right context, or -1 corresponding to the identity of the "pdf-class". Normally the value of the pdf-class is the same as the index of the HMM state, i.e. 0, 1 or 2. Try not to get confused by this: the key is -1, but the value is 0, 1 or 2, and this has no connnection to the 0, 1 or 2 which are the keys of the phones in the context-window. The <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1SplitEventMap.html">SplitEventMap</a> has a set of values that will trigger the "yes" branch of the tree. Below is a kind of quasi-BNF notation that explains the tree-file format. </p><pre class="fragment">         EventMap := ConstantEventMap | SplitEventMap | TableEventMap | "NULL"
 ConstantEventMap := "CE" &lt;numeric pdf-id&gt;
    SplitEventMap := "SE" &lt;key-to-split-on&gt; "[" yes-value-list "]" "{" EventMap EventMap "}"
    TableEventMap := "TE" &lt;key-to-split-on&gt; &lt;table-size&gt; "(" EventMapList ")"
</pre><p>In the example below, the top-level <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1EventMap.html" title="A class that is capable of representing a generic mapping from EventType (which is a vector of (key...">EventMap</a> of the tree is a <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1SplitEventMap.html">SplitEventMap</a> (SE) that splits on key 1, which is the central phone. In square brackets are a contiguous range of phone-ids. As it happens, these don't represent a question, but are just a way of splitting on phones so we can get to the "real" decision trees which are per phone. The issue is that this tree was built with "shared roots", so there are various phone-ids, corresponding to different word-position-and-stress-marked versions of the same phone, that share the root. We can't use a <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1TableEventMap.html">TableEventMap</a> (TE) at the top level of the tree, or we'd have to repeat each decision tree several times (since the <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1EventMap.html" title="A class that is capable of representing a generic mapping from EventType (which is a vector of (key...">EventMap</a> is a pure tree, not a general graph, it has no mechanism for pointers to be "shared"). The next few instances of the "SE" label are also part of this "quasi-tree" which is initially splitting on the central phone (as we go down this file we are going deeper into the tree; notice that the braces "{" are opening but not yet closing). Then we have the string "TE -1 5 ( CE 0 CE 1 CE 2 CE 3 CE 4 )", which represents splitting with a <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1TableEventMap.html">TableEventMap</a> on the pdf-class "-1" (effectively, the HMM-position), and returning values 0 through 4. The values represent the five pdf-ids for the silence and noise phones SIL, NSN and SPN; in our setup, the pdfs are shared between these three non-speech phones (only the transition matrix is specific to each non-speech phone). Note: we have a 5-state rather than 3-state HMM for these phones, hence 5 different pdf-ids. Next is "SE -1 [ 0 ]"; and this can be considered the first "real" question in the tree. We can see from the SE questions above it that it applies when the central phone takes values 5 through 19, which are various versions of the phone AA; and question is asking whether the pdf-class (key -1) has value 0 (i.e. the leftmost HMM-state). Assuming the answer is "yes", the next question is "SE 2 [ 220 221 222 223 ]", which is asking whether the phone to the right is one of various forms of the phone "M" (a rather unintuitive question to ask, since we're in the leftmost HMM-state); if yes, we ask "SE 0 [ 104 105 106 107... 286 287 ]" which is a question about the phone to the right; if yes, then the pdf-id is 5 ("CE 5") and if no, 696 ("CE 696"). </p><pre class="fragment">s3# copy-tree --binary=false exp/tri1/tree - 2&gt;/dev/null | head -100

The ilabel_info object</h1>
<p>The CLG graph (see <a class="el" href="graph.html">Decoding graph construction in Kaldi</a>) has symbols on its input side that represent context-dependent phones (as well as disambiguation symbols and possibly epsilon symbols). In the graph, as always, these are represented by integer labels. We use an object that, in code and in filenames, is generally called ilabel_info. The ilabel_info object 4has a strong connection to the ContextFst objects, see <a class="el" href="graph.html#graph_context">The ContextFst object</a>. As with many other Kaldi types, ilabel_info is a generic (STL) type but we use a consistent variable name to make it identifiable. It is of the following type: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int32&gt; &gt; ilabel_info;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> It is a vector, indexed by the FST input label, that gives for each input label the corresponding phonetic context window (see above, <a class="el" href="tree_externals.html#tree_window">Phonetic context windows</a>). For example, suppose symbol 1500 is phone 30 with a right-context of 12 and a left-context of 4, we would have </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// not valid C++</span></div><div class="line">ilabel_info[1500] == { 4, 30, 12 };</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> In the monophone case, we would have things like: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">ilabel_info[30] == { 28 };</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> There are special cases to deal with disambiguation symbols (see <a class="el" href="graph.html#graph_disambig">Disambiguation symbols</a> or the Springer Handbook paper referenced above for an explanation of what these are). If an ilabel_info entry corresponds to a disambiguation symbol, we put in it the negative of the symbol-table entry of the disambiguation symbol (note that this is not the same as the number of the printed form of the disambiguation symbol as in #0, #1, #2 etc., it is the number corresponding to it in a symbol-table file, which in our current scripts is called phones_disambig.txt). For example, </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">ilabel_info[5] == { -42 };</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> would mean that symbol number 5 on HCLG corresponds to the disambiguation symbol whose integer id is 42. We negate these for scripting convenience, so the programs that interpret the ilabel_info object don't need to be given a list of disambiguation symbols in order to be able to distinguish them from real phones in the monophone case. There are two additional special cases: we have </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">ilabel_info[0] == { }; <span class="comment">// epsilon</span></div><div class="line">ilabel_info[1] == { 0 }; <span class="comment">// disambig symbol #-1;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// we use symbol 1, but don&#39;t consider this hardwired.</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p> The first of these is the normal epsilon symbol, and we give it an empty vector as its ilabel_info entry. This symbol would not normally appear on the left of CLG. The second is a special disambiguation symbol that in printed form is called "#-1". We use it where epsilons are used on the input of the C transducer in the normal (Springer Handbook) recipe; it is needed to ensure determinizability of CLG in the presence of words with empty phonetic representations.</p>
<p>The program <a class="el" href="fstmakecontextsyms_8cc.html">fstmakecontextsyms</a> is able to create a symbol-table that corresponds to the printed form of the ilabel_info object; this is mainly of use for debugging and diagnostics.</p>
<p>As you can see, the ilabel_info object is not very pleasant as it relates to disambiguation symbols, but there are not many parts of the code that interact closely with it: only the fst::ContextFst class (and related things; see context_fst_group), the program <a class="el" href="fstmakecontextsyms_8cc.html">fstmakecontextsyms.cc</a>, and some functions listed in <a class="el" href="group__hmm__group__graph.html">Classes and functions for creating FSTs from HMMs</a>). The <a class="el" href="classkaldi_1_1ContextDependency.html">ContextDependency</a> object, in particular, only sees valid sequences of length N that represent phone context windows. </p>
